# Zed local configuration – keep this in the project root
# -------------------------------------------------------
# This file is read by Zed only for the current workspace.
# It overrides the global defaults and is not checked in
# by default, but you can commit it if you want the
# same interpreter on every machine.

# Specify the exact path to the Python interpreter.
# Replace <path-to-venv> with the relative or absolute
# path to the venv you use for this project.
# Example for a venv named `venv` in the repo root:
#   /var/home/pxperrine/Documents/code/web1/venv/bin/python
# Example for a venv named `.venv` in the repo root:
#   /var/home/pxperrine/Documents/code/web1/.venv/bin/python

language_servers:
  python:
    interpreter: "/var/home/pxperrine/Documents/code/web1/.venv/bin/python"

# Optional: set the working directory for the language server
# (helps if your project uses relative imports).
# working_directory: "/var/home/pxperrine/Documents/code/web1"

# If you use a different virtual‑environment name,
# just edit the path above.  No other Zed settings
# are required for this to work – Zed will pick
# up the interpreter for linting, autocompletion,
# and other Python features.
