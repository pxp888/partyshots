### A photo sharing website written with Vite, Django, postgres and Amazon S3 storage.  

## Structure
This is quite simple.  Users create albums, and albums have files.  Any user is allowed to add files to any album.  
Files may be removed from an album only by the user who posted them, or the creator of the album.  

Everything is public.  


## Todo List

* Lock Album (maybe)
* File Size Limits
* Subscribe to Album
